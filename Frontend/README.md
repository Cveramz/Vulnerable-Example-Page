# SwiftAura Frontend

This is the frontend for the SwiftAura DevSecOps workshop project. Built with React, Vite, and Material UI, it serves as the user interface for interacting with the backend API.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **Material UI (MUI 3)**: A React component library following Material Design principles, used for styling and UI components.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing.

## Project Structure
