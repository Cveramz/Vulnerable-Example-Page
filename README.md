## SwiftAura - a DevSecOps implementation for software ‚≠ê

## Description
This is a simple CRUD for our DevSecOps workshop.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main folders:
- **Backend**: Contains the API and backend logic. Please note that the backend is intentionally vulnerable to allow security testing and is designed to be intercepted by tools like Burp Suite.
- **Frontend**: Contains the user interface with basic security checks. While it includes some basic security measures, its primary focus is to interact with the vulnerable backend.

Each folder has its own README with detailed instructions and setup information for each part.

## Deployment
The project is deployed and accessible at the following URLs:
- **Frontend**: [SwiftAura Frontend](https://swift.cveramz.cl)
- **Backend**: (Fixed - Using Render Service)
